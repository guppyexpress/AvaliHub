        Welcome to AvaliHub website or the AvaliHub mobile application (“Site”). Your portal to the best available seat in the house! The Site is owned and operated by Nebo. This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use and disclose that information and what we do to protect it.
        
        When you use our Site, you trust us with your personal information. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue using our Site.
        
        This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our Site, Short Message Service (SMS), embedded in a partner’s website and mobile application, various social media platforms and any sales and marketing related services (together, “Site”). By using any of these services, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy. Links from our Site or service to third party sites are provided for your convenience. Personal information you provide to such third parties will be governed by that party’s privacy policy and not by AvaliHub. AvaliHub is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites.
        
         
        
        1. Information We Collect
        
        We collect Personal Information from you in several different ways based on the way you interact on our Site such as email address, postal address, and security data.
        
        
        
        Registration; before using certain areas of the Site or ordering products, you may be required to register. During the registration process, you will need to provide certain Personal Information, including but not limited to your email address. This type of personal information is used to fulfil your purchases, to communicate with you about your purchases on our Site, and for marketing purposes. If in the event we encounter any issues when processing your purchases, we use the Personal Information you have provided to contact you.
        
        
        Payment data; we do not collect or store data necessary to process a payment if you make purchases. All payment data (e.g. credit card information) is collected, processed and stored by our third-party credit card processing company who are PCI Compliant. Even when you ask us to remember your credit card, we do not store sensitive payment data such as  entire credit card numbers and CVC. Instead, we pass the payment data to the third-party credit card processing company and receive back from them a token, which does not contain the sensitive data. However, we do retain non-sensitive payment data used to identify a payment such as the last four digits of a card number and expiration date.
        
        
        
        
        Email Addresses. Several locations of the Site may request you to enter or for us to capture your email address for purposes including but not limited to: to register for a certain promotion(s) or product(s); or to request us to notify you regarding particular promotions or products. Your participation in a promotion is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to us. We use this information to notify promotion winners and we may post on our Site the names of contest winners.
        
        
        Cookies and Other Technologies; Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the service more useful to you. Our third party service providers and our Site may use a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the Site. Cookies reside on your computer or mobile device and help the Site recognize your browser as a previous visitor. For example, when you sign into our Site, cookies will be used to save your email address and name so the next time you visit your account from the same device we will "remember" your email address and name in order to make your experience faster and simpler. 
        On occasion our Website may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer the Website. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Website in order to participate). The Site’s cookies do not intrude a user’s hard drive to gather a user’s confidential information.
        
        Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the products and the volumes of usage of the products. For more information on how Google Analytics processes this information, visit www.google.com/analytics.
        
        We use Stripe as a payment provider who use cookies and other similar technologies to help us ensure that our Services function properly, prevent fraud. For more info on Stripe's cookie policy, please visit https://stripe.com/cookies-policy/legal 
        
        The use of cookies by our partners and service providers is not covered by this Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
        
        
        
        Log Files. The Site automatically recognizes the URL or location from which you access the Site. We may also log your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. 
        
        
        Pixel Tags. We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Website pages and HTML-formatted email messages to track your use of our website in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience the next time you visit. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags do not contain any PII and allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened.
        
        
        AvaliHub takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. While our Site is a general audience website, we do not permit anyone under the age of 13 to register with us. We also do not send email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any contact information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the Internet.

        4. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe? 
        
        We aim to protect your personal information through a system of technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. While we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Site is at your own risk. You should only access the Site from a secure environment. 
        
        We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To guard your information delivered to us electronically, our Website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your contact information, we cannot guarantee that personal identifiable information supplied by users will not be improperly accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of unauthorized access to our files, or interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers. If you have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of the Website, please contact us at guppyexpress@gmail
        
        We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.
        
        
        
        Access to your personal information is restricted and only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. We rely on third-party service providers, for the physical security of our computer hardware, to comply with commercially reasonable security practices and measures. For example, when you visit our Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall. While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline. As such, you assume the risk of security breaches and all consequences resulting from them. To that end, please safeguard your credentials.
        
        
        5. Users Outside the United States
        
        The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Site from Australia, Canada or the European Union, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your use of the Site, you are transferring your personal information to the United States, and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by Louisiana law for these purposes. 
        
        
        6. Do We Make Updates To This Policy?
